A conservative brain mask is needed for BBR registration with epi_reg. It is not
a problem if the brain mask misses some non-brain tissue, as it is only used for
BBR registration.

Please place the brai nmask with the following file names in ".../08_bbr_prep":

	brain_mask_t1w_for_bbr.nii.gz

A brain mask for the mean epi image does not seem to have an effect on the BBR
registration. Providing a manual white matter segmentation (instead of using the
one created automatically by epi_reg) seems to *decrease* the quality of the
registration.
