Please create a liberal brain masked based on the PDw mp2rage image. For this,
apply retinex to the original PDw image, and use itksnap for creation of the
mask afterwards.

This brain mask should not miss any brain tissue and should include some
non-brain tissue (skull etc.), it is only needed to remove noise outside the
head for the pre-registration.
