Please create a liberal brain mask based on the PDw mp2rage image. (For example
using itksnap.)

This brain mask should not miss any brain tissue, and can include some non-brain
tissue (skull etc.). It is only needed for removing noise outside the head for
the pre-registration.

Place the brain mask in the following folder:

~/nii/mp2rage/03_reg/02_brainmask
