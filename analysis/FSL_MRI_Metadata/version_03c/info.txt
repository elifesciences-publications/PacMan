In session 20171109, there was an additional, improvised 8th run with long rest
and stimulus blocks (50 s and 25 s, respectively). The purpose of this run was
to investigate the temporal dynamics of the negative fMRI signal. The respetive
design matrix is called `PacMan_run_Long_eventmatrix.txt` in the experiment
folder (`~/05_PacMan/20171109/log/PacMan/experiment/design_matrices/`). It is
renamed to `PacMan_run_08_eventmatrix.txt` here.
