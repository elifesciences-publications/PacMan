### Missing REST block

In session 20171023, the last rest block of every functional run was skipped
because of a bug. The volumes corresponding to this last rest block were
cropped from the functional time series (after preprocessing, in the folder
`func_reg_distcorUnwrp`. However, this has no implications for the FSL EV
files, because rest blocks are not modelled anyway.


### pRF mapping & additional control condition

Summary:

- func_07 is the pRF mapping run.
- func_08 and func_09 contain an additional control condition ('PacMan static').

Full story:

Also, in session 20171023, the retinotopic mapping run is referred to as
func_07. The last two runs, correpsonding to an additional control condition
('PacMan static'), are named func_08 and func_09. However, for those runs the
design matrices named `PacMan_run_07_eventmatrix.txt` and
`PacMan_run_08_eventmatrix.txt` were used for stimulus presentation. For
simplicity, the respective design matrices were renamed:

`PacMan_run_07_eventmatrix.txt` --> `PacMan_run_08_eventmatrix.txt`

and 

`PacMan_run_08_eventmatrix.txt` --> `PacMan_run_09_eventmatrix.txt`
