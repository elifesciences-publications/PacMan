Please create a liberal brain mask based on the PDw mp2rage image. (For example
using itksnap.)

This brain mask should not miss any brain tissue, and can include some non-brain
tissue (skull etc.). It is only needed for removing noise outside the head for
the pre-registration.

Place the brain mask in the following folder:

${pacman_anly_path}${pacman_sub_id}/06_mp2rage/n_04b_${pacman_sub_id}_pwd_brainmask.nii.gz
